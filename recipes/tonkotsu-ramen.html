    <p>
        Tonkotsu ramen is a popular ramen dish which originated in Kurume, 
        Fukuoka Prefecture, which is located on the northern shore of 
        Kyushu island in Japan. It was originally prepared as an affordable 
        fast food which was easily prepared for laborers at fish markets.
        Now, it serves as a comfortable, warming, and <strong><em>hearty meal</em></strong> for all
        demographics.

        Chashu pork belly
        </em>
    </h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine the soy, sake, mirin, sugar, garlic and green onions in a 
            ziploc bag large enough to hold the pork belly. Stick a straw 
            in the bag and seal the ziploc</li>

        <li>Stick a straw in the bag and seal the ziploc bag up against
            it (so the straw is the only opening). Suck as much of the air
            as you can and seal.
        </li>

        <li>Vacuum seal and immerse the pork in warm water for 10-11 
            hours at 170 degrees Fahrenheit. Discard the bag and marinate.</li>

        <li>Let the chashu pork belly cool completely.</li>   

        <li>Slice across the chashu pork - <em>(so you get bacon like slices)</em> 
            - into 8-12 slices about 1/8 to 3/16 inches thick. Reserve the pork because
            you will not need all of it for four servings.</li> 
        
    </ol>

    </h3>

    
    <ol>
        <li>COmbine all the ingredients in a small sauce pan. Simmer at
            the lowest setting for about an hour. Top up with a bit of chicken
            stock if needed.
        </li>
        
        <li>Remove the bacon.</li>

    </ol>

        Miso tare
        </em>
    </h3>


    <ol>
        <li>Combine all ingredients in a small sauce pan and simmer at 
            the lowest setting for about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>
        <em>
            Medium boiled eggs
        </em>
    </h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Bring enough water to cover the eggs to a boil.
            If you have a way to prick the eggshell, then do it.
            Boil large eggs for 6 minutes and 30 seconds. 
            <ul>
                <li>If you are using large eggs, boil them for 7 
                    minutes and 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>You may have to adjust your times slightly depending 
                    on the exact size of your eggs but this should get 
                    you pretty close.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Submerge the eggs in cold or ice water to chill. This stops 
            the egg yolks from continuing to set up. Peel. Cut in half
            right before you serve your tonkotsu ramen.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>
        <em>
            Assemble the tonkotsu ramen
        </em>
    </h3>

    <ol>

        <li>Boil the ramen noodles in plenty of water as directed by the 
            packaging. If there's no translation on the packaging usually
            it's 4 minutes.</li>
            <ul>
                <strong>
                    <li>You don't need to salt the water.</li>
                </strong>
            </ul>
        <li>Cook the mushrooms along side the noodles - you just want them softened.</li>
        <li>Gently fry the chashu pork in a non-stick skillet until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Place 1/4 of whichever tare you are using in the bottom of four bowls.</li>
        <li>Ladle in about 1/2 cup of the tonkotsu broth into each of the bowls and stir to mix.</li>
        <li>Add the noodles.</li>
        <li>Pour in another one and a half cups of the tonkotsu broth per bowl.</li>
        <li>Top with the egg, mushrooms, pork and green onions.</li>

    </ol>
