    <p>
        A <strong>casserole</strong> or <em>"hot dish"</em> is a baked food 
        with pieces of meat like chicken, various vegetables, and a starchy
        binder like flour, potato, or pasta. There is also often a crunchy 
        or cheesy topping. 
    </p>
    <p>
        This kind of <em>baked food</em> is usually served as a 
        <strong>main course</strong> or <strong>side 
        dish</strong> and can be served in the same dish that it was cooked in.
